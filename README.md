This application contains a landing page that talks about the Filter Bubbles phenomenon, and then leads to two other pages - preference dispersion simularion, and an alternate recommendations, realtime movie recommender system.

The simulation is contrived from the "The Dissemination of Culture - A model with Local Convergence and Global Polarization" (Axelrod, 1997). The recommender systems rely on the alternate algorithms are from the "Recommender Systems for Self-Actualization" (Knijnenburg et al., 2016).

This project uses the RSSA-API <https://github.com/ShahanM/rssaapi> to gather the recommendations.
